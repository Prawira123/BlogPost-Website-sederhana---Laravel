    <p >First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
    Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
    documentation.</p>
    <p >It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
        and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
    <p >You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
            guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
    to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
    purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
